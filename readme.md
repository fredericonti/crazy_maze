# Sweet Maze

This is the first game that I did for the first part (Module 1) of IronHack Web Development Bootcamp from Brazil. We Made it! o/

## Acknowledgments( What I've learned)
First! I would like to thank God and  would like to thanks to my girlfriend (to support me for this course! I hope you stay with me until I finish this course!How I love you!), @Coe, for the patience and for all the tips during this course! You are the men! I really appreciate your job +) and all my colleagues that I've been choosing to be my friends, to always take by the hand and give me strenght to keep going after all those hard moments(to learn! you got it!)

## Prerequisites

## Introduction to this (a)maze game

Maze it's a platform game wich the player have to escape into those paths to exit the game. This is a demo version so, if you guys like, support this author with a job! =)

## Game rules

This a simple game:

• Move the character with the arrow cursors(up,down,left and right) from your keyboard and yes, It's easy and pretty fun!;
• You must get into the finish line, you must match with the most sweetest sweet ever and it is the end of the game!;
• If you reach the goal! Congrats! you arevthe winner and you deserve to a hug!

## Game and Coding Improvements

During the development, I had only 4 days to really get into this job and make it run without any issues. The hardest part it was the JS logical part and the way to do the "guy" walk throught those `arrays` and so on, all the thing goes fluid and be soft to you, user and player of my game.

### GAME IMPROVEMENTS

* Restart your game after you reach the goal;
* All animations I did for you to have fun for just passing trought this game (even if its a demo mode).

### CODE IMPROVEMENTS

* I made the best to write an organized code. Beside the execution time lenght it as good to did some improvements, I could't take this long because I was wokring a lot on my real job. But feel free to contribute and organize all this code as you wish. 
* This code have an important issue: Some parts of this code was wrote in portuguese(brazillian) just for my best comprehension to code because I'm a begginner. Feel free to change that!=)
